	<p>This course provides a practical introduction to the rapidly growing field of machine learningâ€” training predictive models to generalize to new data. 
		We start with linear and logistic regression and implement gradient descent for these algorithms, the core engine for training. 
		With these key building blocks, we work our way to understanding widely used neural network architectures, 
		focusing on intuition and implementation with TensorFlow/Keras. While the course centers on neural networks, we will make sure to cover key ideas in unsupervised learning and nonparametric modeling.</p>
	<p>Along the way, <b>weekly short coding assignments</b> will connect lectures with concrete data and real applications.
		A more <b>open-ended final project</b> will tie together crucial concepts in experimental design and analysis with models and training.</p>
	<p> This class meets for one 90 min class periods each week.</p>
	<p> All materials for this course are posted on GitHub in the form of Jupyter notebooks.</p>

<p> Integrating a diverse set of experiences is important for a more comprehensive understanding of machine learning. 
I will make an effort to read papers and hear from a diverse group of practitioners, still, limits exist on this diversity in the field of machine learning. 
I acknowledge that it is possible that there may be both overt and covert biases in the material due to the lens with which it was created. 
I would like to nurture a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities 
(including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, veteran status, etc.) in the spirit of the <a href="https://diversity.berkeley.edu/principles-community">UC Berkeley Principles of Community.</a></p>

<p> To help accomplish this, please contact me or submit anonymous feedback through I School channels if you have any suggestions to improve the quality of the course.
If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that you prefer I use, please let me know. 
If something was said in class (by anyone) or you experience anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. 
If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by experiences outside of class, please donâ€™t hesitate to come and talk with me. 
I want to be a resource for you. Also, anonymous feedback is always an option, and may lead to me to make a general announcement to the class, if necessary, 
to address your concerns.</p> 
	  
<p>As a participant in teamwork and course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates.</p> 

<p>If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, MICS Academic Director Lisa Ho, I School Assistant Dean of Academic Programs Catherine Cronquist Browning,
and the UC Berkeley Office for Graduate Diversity are excellent resources. Also see the following <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/about/community">link.</a></p>
